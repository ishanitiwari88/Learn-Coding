# Learn-Coding
Hey folks! I'm making a repo of super basic coding projects that anyone can try to learn coding from scratch. I’ve been there—watching endless Python tutorials and taking courses that don’t really help until you sit down and actually start coding (and low-key cry over your bad code ).

So, here’s my plan: I’ll drop a bunch of simple projects that might not sound cool at all, but they’ll help me (and maybe you) nail the basics.


TIPS:

#Try writing pseudo code first

#Figure out what the end goal is, then break it into small steps (sit with a pen and paper if needed)

#Try not to have a peek at the solution

#Make sure you get loops, conditionals, and lists/tuples/dicts before diving in.

#Write bad code. Like, really bad. Then fix it up later. Progress over perfection, always!

LET'S THINK IN PYTHON!
