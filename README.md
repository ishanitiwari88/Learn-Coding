# Learn-Coding
Hey folks! I'm going to make this repository of very basic projects that you can follow to learn coding. 
I've learnt it the hard way but watching lectures and attending online courses for python is of no practical use until you sit down and scratch your eyes out while attempting to code and write really bad snippets ;)

In this attempt of learning to code, I'm going to make of list of projects that may not sound cool at all, but will clear my basic concepts.

TIPS:

#try writing pseudo code first

#understand the goal or the output that is required, then think about the steps (sit with a pen and paper if needed)

#try not to have a peek at the solution

#clear concepts of loops, conditional statements, and lists-tuple-dicts before starting

#write shitty codes first and then improvise

LET'S THINK IN PYTHON!
